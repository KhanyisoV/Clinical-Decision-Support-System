## Cancer Prediction API (FastAPI + XGBoost)

This project provides a machine learning API built with FastAPI for predicting cancer types based on user-provided symptoms.
It uses an XGBoost classifier and includes a pre-trained model for demonstration purposes.

### Features

RESTful API built with FastAPI

Predicts cancer type from user symptoms

JSON-based input/output

Easy to test with Swagger UI or Postman

Ready for integration with web or mobile frontends

### Installation Guide

Follow these steps carefully to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Create a Virtual Environment

A virtual environment keeps dependencies isolated.

python -m venv venv

### Activate the Virtual Environment

venv\Scripts\activate

When active, your terminal prompt should show:

(venv) >

### Install Required Dependencies

pip freeze > requirements.txt

### Run the FastAPI Server
uvicorn main:app --reload


You should see something like:

INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)

### 🌐 How to Test the Model

You can now interact with your model using 3 methods:

🔹 Option 1: Swagger UI

Visit:

### 👉 http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

This will open an interactive web interface where you can test predictions easily.

🔹 Option 2: ReDoc

Visit:

### 👉 http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc

This provides a clean documentation view of all endpoints.
